Description: Neighbourhood functions are key components
  of local-search algorithms such as Simulated Annealing
  or Threshold Accepting.  These functions take a
  solution and return a slightly-modified copy of it,
  i.e. a neighbour.  The package provides a single
  function, neighbourfun(), that produce a neighbourhood
  function, based on various parameters such as minimum
  or maximum values.  Currently supported are numeric
  and logical solutions.  The algorithms were originally
  created for portfolio-optimization models, but can
  also be used for other models.
