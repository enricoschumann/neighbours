Description: Neighbourhood functions are key components
  of local-search algorithms such as Simulated
  Annealing or Threshold Accepting.  These functions
  take a solution and return a slightly-modified copy
  of it, i.e. a neighbour.  The package provides a
  function neighbourfun() that constructs such
  neighbourhood functions, based on various parameters
  such as admissible ranges for elements in a solution.
  Supported are numeric and logical solutions.  The
  algorithms were originally created for
  portfolio-optimization applications, but can be used
  for other models as well.
