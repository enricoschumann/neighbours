v0.1-0  (2020-04-16)

  o Initial release.  The package provides a function
    neighbourfun() that constructs neighbourhood
    functions for local-search algorithms.  Supported
    are numeric and logical solutions.  The algorithms
    were originally created for portfolio-optimisation
    applications, but can be used for other models as
    well.  The package also provides a helper function
    for comparing solutions.
