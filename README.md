# neighbours

Neighbourhood functions are key components of
local-search algorithms such as Simulated Annealing or
Threshold Accepting.  These functions take a solution
and return a slightly-modified copy of it, i.e. a
neighbour.  The package provides a single function,
neighbourfun(), that produce a neighbourhood function,
based on various parameters such as minimum or maximum
values.  Currently supported are numeric and logical
solutions.  The algorithms were originally created for
portfolio-optimization models, but can also be used for
other models.
